# The Entertainer Plugin
Plugin developed to push the boundaries of minecraft and get the most out of the game. The plugin offers several interesting ideas and activities 
that have not been seen before in the minecraft scene. For example, we speak from Tetris to various interesting features.

An extensively developed tetris game ready to go into multiplayer gaming. A game to play with your friends and have fun.
Breaking each other's records is the goal here.

Also push your limits by testing/playing the different features.

As you see in this screenshot, the game was made in about 24hours. 2.5 Days of 12 hours work :D

### Conclusion
As you saw in the screenshots, there is a custom made texturepack available. The game also includes sounds like the original tetris sound etc...
